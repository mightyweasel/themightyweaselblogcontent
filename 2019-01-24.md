Welcome to the weasel war dance.
It's in my job title to disrupt. So I will share the skills I learn. Because magic belongs to everyone.
Everything here is my own personal opinion - I speak in no official capacity on behalf of any organization private or public. But I promise to be open, helpful, and trustworthy. -Sinan
The blank page is where so many of us start. Doesn't matter if you're a coder, memorandum writer, oil paint artist, or experimental jazz-rock fusion musician. What we do with that page is where the magic happens.
And it's all magic.
Who the stoat ermine? I am The Mighty Weasel. Ottawa, Canada homegrown half-analog half-digital 80s kid. I'm a millennial, metal head, petter of cat dragons. I dream things. I build things. And as of early January 2019 on contract serving the Canadian public as the Disruption Lead, Canada School of Public Service, Digital Academy.
I want anyone reading this to hear me. The Canadian Government is serious about a digital transformation.
In two weeks working for the Canadian public service I've checked off more of my bucket list development goals than I could have imagined.
Wanted to start my own github repository and start building things to make a digital future for Canada possible and positive. Done.
Wanted to build a responsive mobile graphing dashboard in d3. Done.
Wanted to build a Go web app and figure out speech synthesis/recognition. Done.
Wanted to build a Python/Flask AI-enabled knowledge assistant available in a browser. Done.
I want anyone reading this to hear me. The Canadian Government is serious about a digital transformation. The people I've met and worked with in the last two week have literally (not figuratively) enabled me to produce the things I dream of.
We got our first cloud app deployed in three days. We build our first functional prototype of an Artificial Intelligence enabled chat bot / searcher / re-director in 24 hours. We got docker to dock. Azure to sing. Go to go. Python to py. Oh motherboard I could cry.
We are encouraged to share what we learn. I've already given a crash course in SASS to my colleagues, who quickly become fast friends when you're passion project coding deep into the morning, not because of any deadlines or direct command. But because you're so switched on, eh!
This story I intend to keep fresh, because who likes stale stories. Musty smells should be left for books, which you must still crack once in a while just to inhale the scent of textual data plotted over time using cellulose as a medium. There's much more to learn from the analog while we build the digital
I hope to be a humble guide, and while you're here. If you wanna know where my heads at, you should read this.
And if you got this far, forgive me for a list of links on where to go next. More stories will come. Until then.
