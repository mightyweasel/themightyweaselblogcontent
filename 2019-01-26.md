# Crash Course: Basic Go Web Application
## To learn you must do, there is no sigh.

### Part 1: Begin at the beginning, continue till the end, then stop

Ok, maybe a few sighs. In software you get used to learning curves. You also get acquainted with lovecraftian despair and a thrill similar I can only guess to tail-fiving the [salmon of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_of_Knowledge)

This wont be the shortest how-to you've come across. Or the most conventional. But writing code is like writing stories. The best ones are ones that teach you something and take you somewhere along the way. If you're pressed for time: [Youtube has tons of smart people sharing their smarts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI) - and you can find a [working basic Go web app on our github here](https://github.com/DIS-SIN/gobasicbits). May your code compile and your commits be clean.

#### Introduction, Mental Preparation

If life was a game and you had to spend your skill points, much like luck, spending a few in learning to learn is never bad plan. If there's one skill that has come in useful time and time again it's that.

> Be comfortable in admitting you know nothing (yet). Be passionate about learning anything (always).

You never know what kind of cross-discipline skills will transfer. The best part of the processor between your ears is how much parallel computation it can do on 20 watts. That book you read. That dinner you cooked. That conversation you had. All part of the same information map.

[When someone builds something cool](https://github.com/ToferC), part of the digital mindset is to figure it out. When I started building websites in 1997 there wasn't an easy to get the answers you needed with the speed, ease, and accuracy you can get today. Frameworks? Try <frameset>s. Rounded corners? Try a 9-cell table abuse. (Note: schoolyard dust ups over semantic vs. syntactic meaning of html were aflame during this time. You also had to account for so many different user agents without any clear concise documentation a google away).

> When it come to development, a golden rule is: strong opinions, loosely held.

Back then, in the basement [singing the song of the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHW1ho8L7V8) I'd right-click, view-source. There it was. The code that make things live in cyberspace. I was in a new world. You'd take it apart like you would a VCR. Piece by piece in piles like lego blocks. Snapping and pressing things together until a patch work of brackets and letters created something that someone on the other side of the world could see.

It was hard going. And you had to get used to failing. Again. (And again.)+ 

But I was happy saying I knew nothing. Because it meant my feet were on the ground. There was only one way to go. Up. But we all look up from our own wells of "don't know it" and the only thing stopping us from climbing after anything we choose is 1) where do I start 2) how do I start - this is where we face the learning curve.

Somethings invite you in. And you get it easily. Others, due to existing training in your head (your current effective models), just don't [grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok).

> Example: For a long time I had no clue how a [gradient descent intuitively worked](https://medium.com/@hakobavjyan/stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd-10ce70fea389). It wasn't until [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) that it clicked. Oh. You're on a hill trying to get to the bottom. Look around. Figure out your best step. Take it. Repeat. Sometimes the missing variable is analogy and time.

Breaking through this part is the hardest step. It's going to cause some [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). But the moment you boot that process up the magic begins.

For me, the project I'm focusing on is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Up until a few days ago, I couldn't pick Go syntax out of a line-up even if it did knock me over, sit on me, and take my lunch money. (Which it did in the learning stage. Oh how it did. But it wasn't Go, it was me. We cool now.)

#### 10 PRINT "LEARN!", 20 GOTO 10, RUN

So you've accepted it's gonna be a long night, you've got your [favorite tunes going in your ears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efQHga1BZz8), and you're ready. Now what.

Everyone starts with [hello world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program). And so do I. But I find a hello world is a misleading comfort. I've gone to bed smile a smile, and woken up no more competent than before I started. To learn you must do. And you gotta do enough that you'll be challenged. Not so much you'll get beaten down. But enough that you'll need an epsom salt bath afterward.

When I need to learn a new language, my favorite learning exercise is to build a basic web application with all generic bells and whistles I always seem to end up needing. Things like:

* Basic routes for serving pages and serving responses
* HTML/JS/CSS templates
* JSON flat file data loads and/or DB functionality
* Mobile responsiveness and "good enough" UI/UX for alpha purposes
* Something I can use to help others learn what I did

That's what we'll be covering in this crash course. I've got a [basic Go web app on Github.com here](https://github.com/DIS-SIN/gobasicbits) if you like to follow along with code instead of prose.

#### Install

First thing, you have to get things installed. This is where I would usually get hung of for hours sometimes days fighting in the console or registry, scouring the forums for some cryptic piece of arcane wisdom that would just make the baud-hanged thing work. It's better these days. But it's still not the fun part for me. Some of my friends love it. It takes a village to make this stuff work.

Still. [Press on and wingardium installi_O_sum.](https://golang.org/doc/install)

#### I know kung-fu. Show me.

Once you've navigated the myriad of windows and approved everything... start installing the content into your brain.

[I started here]("https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/") while referencing [this content here]("https://golang.org/doc/code.html"). It's important to understand the accent of a language before you start trying to speak. Sometimes intonation is the difference between "awesome that worked" and "oh sweet motherboard it's 4 am again".

> Perhaps we should pause and issue a disclaimer - this is how I like to learn things, and it doesn't work for everyone. If you're a morning person, just apply your time shift algos and all should be good. Same goes if you like to digest things between learning sessions. Everyone has a different algorithm in their head for moving things from short term memory to long term memory. I've also got some friends who [don't visually imagine things (aphantasia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia), so there is no tried and true on size fits all method. Every learner is unique. But that's a problem we can solve by tailoring learning to each person. Hard problem today. Hopefully trivial in the next few decades.

Once you've got the basic grunts and hand signals down. It's time to start. I like to start with a basic HTML/CSS/JS template I knock together. But a quick google search can give you many options. I also like to pick a simple to include framework to handle most of the legwork for me. Why re-invent the wheel. 

There is a catch here. I've had the blessing to have failed in almost every single way possible when it comes to building my ideas. And the only difference between failing uselessly and failing with purpose is documenting and pushing through the pain. Once you've failed enough, you'll start asking the right questions. Those questions will lead you to the right answers. There's also an art in selecting the right answer from a host of "right answers".

When you feel lost in the worry about how elegant or efficient your code is. Or if you start fretting about what exact implementation of something is. Remember one thing. You have time to learn all that. Your goal is to "ship it, working, yesterday", your client is you! And you gotta put kibble in the cat's bowl.

It's ok if it's not the best yet. That's what code review is for. But you need to have something to show to review. And with ideas, sometimes there's a lot lost in translation between "hey look at this cool thing!" and "what is it?". Let's get something real into our hands.

Go was an interesting change for me. I'm used to the web being pretty loose. We were spoiled in the early days by browsers that would chew up any [tag soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_soup) you'd throw at them and try their darndest to render something half way between what you were hoping for. Coding for it was a nightmare of shims and hooks and hacks and general quackery. 

We also had the [`<blink>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink) tag, so no generation is without their share of the blame.

Go flips that right on its head. Do it right. Or don't do it. 

#### In the darkest places, the dimmest light shines like a star

Now the burst load. You have to just immerse yourself in the water. Like getting into Lake Superior. If you don't embrace it. It won't embrace you back. Start fixing the things that just don't work. You're going to get real familiar with the error console here. And you might not know it yet, but this is going to give you the needed intuition to really make this all work. Failing with purpose again.

In my own quest to get the basic web app to work I ran into dark magic.

[Serving css as something other than text/css?]("https://forum.golangbridge.org/t/serving-css-files/2386/7") Who do you think you are? [Trying to access a static file on a path you think exists on the file system]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28899675/include-js-file-in-go-template/28899786#28899786")? LOL|LEL|KEK the filesystem doesn't exist until you will it into existence. Heck, even [where do the things even actually live?]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28745161/with-golang-webserver-where-does-the-root-of-the-website-map-onto-the-filesystem/28745280#28745280")

There are little bits of magic like this in every language. These are [the brambles]("https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1f8ue5/web_app_code_layoutorganization/") and [thorns]("https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/29ay5j/rookie_how_do_i_organize_my_code_into_multiple/") you just have to get used to being scraped by. They [will all heal]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23925005/function-declaration-in-golang"). And you will be [better for it]("https://medium.com/golangspec/init-functions-in-go-eac191b3860a").

So many of the guides I come across tell you how easy all of this is. How you'll be a wizard in no time. I definitely don't promise that. It takes time to fail enough to get good. 

[Speaking of which git good with git.](https://github.com/) It's easy to start. You can use it for almost anything, even if you're not what you consider a "coder". And it will give you a closer look into the state of the art. These are the parks and gardens of the digital future. Come take a look at the seedlings. You won't believe how fast they can grow into a mighty oak.

[Thankfully people have our backs here.]("https://curtisvermeeren.github.io/2017/09/14/Golang-Templates-Cheatsheet") and this is one of the things that makes learning development (even in a awareness-only capacity is important)

The entire walk a kilometer in someones shoes is a real thing. The garden is always greenest where you water it.

Still you'll find yourself [asking basic questions]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33027070/variables-inside-templates-in-golang") and then asking
[not so basic questions]("http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux"). But you'll start to piece it together line at a time. 

[You'll find out how to be heard]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15407719/in-gos-http-package-how-do-i-get-the-query-string-on-a-post-request") and you'll [find out how to be found](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2014/03/exportedunexported-identifiers-in-go.html")

Finally when the error console, which you now can refer to as the console or terminal again, is quiet. You'll know you've calmed the beast, stretched your synapses, and are ready to [work on your grammar and vocabulary[\]("https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html")

#### Where do we go from here

In Part 2 we'll take a deeper look into the actual code of the basicbits sample code you found at the top of the story. I'll get into the gritty details for a bit more a technical audience. But I don't want to alienate the curious. My mission always has been to share the awesome with everyone.

Even [17-18 years ago my aspirational values and mission](https://web.archive.org/web/20021122205334/http://netrodents.com/) were centered around the human on the other end of the screen. 

> Amidst the stream of digital media on the web these days, one core value tends to become lost when designing a web site. The notion of usability. No matter how "flashy" or "interactive" a site may be, unless it gives the user the information in a usable functional fashion, the user becomes lost and frustrated.

I was in high school. But no one listens to kids right?

> strive to make web pages that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but fast & functional as well. A simple rule is that a user will not wait for rich media to download. They want information fast, and they appreciate being able to find what they are looking for with minimal delay. 

But everything I know now is because I can pull on the repositories of giants.

> strive to provide the bridge between beauty & utility.

See you in the the int void()
