# Digital is a Human Challenge: You can't reboot a human
## Well, you can... But [sinoatrial nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinoatrial_node) aren't [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

The future is digital?

One of my favorite ways to explain the mindset of someone who has spent most of their adult life dealing with technology is like this:

> def ask_techie_to_fix(a not-working car): techie.will(["turn car off","open all doors","roll down all windows","roll up all windows","close all doors","restart car"]

The Baud RAM'd car will start. Techie will nod, knowingly. At a moment aloof in triumph, and utterly defeated by the deep and dark arcane arts that caused the issue in the first place.

The hilarious part is, this works for a good 90% of issues you run into. It's a little barbaric when you think about it, graceful shutdowns are nice for a reason. But growing up in the 80s/90s you got used to tech get getting CTRL+ALT+DEL or just snapping off the power (5 seconds on the power button these days it seems). 

But you can't blame some of us. I've used mobile devices where the accepted way to fix certain errors was to remove the entire battery from the unit. It's "natural".

> But natural doesn't equate to ideal for humans. Bears are natural. Running into bear is natural. The predator-prey cycle is natural. 

Technological progress is also to a large degree a natural cycle. The issue is, lots of us humans, despite having one of the best energy efficient parallel processors in the world, have a hard time really understanding the exponential and geometric growth curves.

[Well not all humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4PTvXtz4GM&t=11m00s), we're all have our own special ingredients to share with the world

> [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... uh oh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth)

It doesn't seem like much. But I promise you, these kind of patterns run away from you faster than a cat who falls into a bathtub by accident.

The issue is, technological progress is on pace to do exactly this. It's going to be like switching from a [penny farthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing) to a [boosted haybusa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrWQfjgIT6I). However us humans are currently not equipped to handle intense changes like this in ultra short time frames. We can, and do, adapt to many varied situations. You could argue it's one of the reasons we're almost everywhere on earth. But that adaptation doesn't come easy, and it's never simple.

When we talk about digital, we should refine the [overloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) term a bit. When I talk about digital, I'm referring to the next step in connection and interaction. I'm talking about the digital transformation of government and the citizenry. From the last time I checked nearly 2/3rds of the human population (5 Billion humans) have mobile phones.

There a supercomputers that outbest the [code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hamilton_(scientist)) and [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_rope_memory) that put us into space and on the moon.

I stop and think about how many times I've hear people say "I wish they consulted them!", "Didn't they think about this or that?", "What about this thing that does that for those?". The issue is, with so many human voices and human ears. The sheer bandwidth is a torrent. It's just too loud and noisy. 

That's why [something like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) hasn't gained traction. You just can't do it, you have to organize into smaller and smaller groups to get things done. That's not too different than computer architecture if you look at it. The CPU instructs. The RAM knows where to find things. The HDD remembers. The GPU (doodling artsy misfit), has now read a few things and is currently crushing it in the financial and machine learning markets. Things have a tendency to grow up. And get better.

But back to the super computers in our pockets. Many of my technologically inclined friends like to say "the problem is solved". They've got the world at their fingertips. Offloading salt and banana storage in neuron to the electrons and ferrous platters in the cloud.

But the problem isn't solved. Even if we were able to access the root magic of our world and will things into existence, having the magic wand doesn't imbue you with magical wisdom.

> The problem with the digital future is... It's a human problem.

We have to solve the human problems. The technology was never the issue.

Developers will tell you the AGILE method is the way to go. Then eventually like all things in tech you'll get the sub-pockets of supports. KANBAN! ROWE! Someone in the back will try waterfall, but it's ok. They've got their reasons.

But these arguments still miss the point.

The point is, at the end of the day, we're all squishy humans who might prefer a hug over a hard-drive. The questions we should be asking are:

* How do we find the right metaphors and analogies to actually relate with the humans who will use this stuff
* How do we, as techies, write the interface to explain why we care so deeply about what might seem trivial
* How do we, as leaders, empower over direct while maintaining stability and trust
* How do we, as a public service, embrace a mindset of purposeful disruption for public good
* How do we, as a nation, prepare and plan for a future where EVERY Canadian can and will have a voice that can echo loudly in the house of commons.

These aren't easy questions. There are no simple answers. No magic to teach us how to use magic. It's going to be arcane tomes, and strange incantations. And arguments.

We are going to fight. But we're going to have strong opinions which are loosely held. We are going to realize this is us against the odds, not you vs. us vs. me vs. technology. We're going to make this work together. And we are going to be better for it.

In an upcoming story I'm going to talk about the skills and mindset that will make this digital transformation something to get excited about.

I promise you, my readers who are doing their level best to keep the fires at bay, the day-to-day reality realizing, the real core of what needs to be done because it must - you are the biggest part of the digital revolution.

You know what hurts. What is slow. What is painful. You know what you've had to do to make it work. You know how hard it was to get A to related to and agree with B.

You hold the keys to the future. Your challenges are the challenges we need to solve.

All I ask from you is this. Allow yourself to be open to positive surprise.

There are wizards everywhere in the public service - and a large majority of them have never coded a line of anything ever. As techies, it's our duty to learn from them, and understand the deep magic they know.

I can wrangle a [Python](https://www.python.org/), sure.

But these wizards... they can wrangle a room or a budget.

That's some pretty awesome magic.

Techies. Let's work to empower them. Get ready to invoke(magic)

[As uncle ben personified...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Ben#%22With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility%22)

> With great power comes great responsibility

Remember always to wield it wisely

So where do we start my fellow humans? With each other. Let's really talk about this. Not just the magic. But the junk too. We've got a lot of spring cleaning ahead of us.

But I promise you, when the nooks and crannies are clean, we're all going to wonder how we got by without it.

The future is human.
