# Digital Skills Series: Adapters and Interfaces
## How I programmed my cat with phonemes and signals

No you didn't read that wrong. I actually want to tell you about how I wrote an interface using human words and hand signals executed on a mackerel fish to feline operant training stack. Yes this will be a concrete example of digital skills and thinking. It will be a bit different... Purrgive me. No. Bad pun.

> Read: fed her fish and waved until we spoke the same language

People will tell you dogs are our best friend. I'm not going to argue the point. I'm a cat person. But I understand why dog people are dog people. I also prefer the heavier side of things. And I'm a bit eccentric.

This is Telo Mhrr (named after the telomeres at the end of your DNA, obvs.)

This is what we have trained her to do.https://www.instagram.com/p/BYedqrXgPIE/

What I won't argue is how much better the dog.interface() is for just getting along in the same space. Come here. Wanna go for a walk? The developers of the dog system really thought about the actual end user (the human) in the process. 

> Hey? Should we think about making this run in a cluster? You mean have a bunch of dogs in a pack? Yeah! Great idea. What about if we need them to stop knocking the kid over? Nice, they grok our intentions and want to be a part of the group. Nice work developers. Commit the code!

Cats. 

Cats are like working in linux. If you figure out the unwritten rules and really invest some time into adjusting to it's flow in the terminal, the way it expects things. Eventually you start to get along. Then you become unstoppable.

The trick here - and our first introduction into digital thinking - is figuring out how to adapt and starting to figure out what the dials and knobs of a thing do. 

Developers, at least most these days, think in terms of what we can Objects. It really does mean what you think it does. A vague nebulous THING, that will do (or maybe not) other THINGS. This thing, being a thing, knows things about itself. It also, being a thing, can do some other things. There's no end to the kind of things it can be, do, or represent. 

For developers... almost everything in the world can be represented by an Object. When we approach a problem, the first thing we do is figure out what the thing does. And we usually do this by poking around and trying things. Hopefully never breaking it in the process (or at least fixing it if we do)

In the case of Telo, I had a general understanding of cats. Fluffy ninjas with murder-mittens. Aloof, but aware. Predator and also prey. Slowly I started to jot things down I knew. What worked. What didn't. Not with any purpose at first, just a raw curiosity to figure it out.

But some smart folks say: The different between science and screwing around is writing it down

I learned that Telo loves, in a deeply spiritual way, mackerel. It's the reward that provides the best neurotransmitter response. The bingo treat.

Armed with this knowledge I set out to implement one function on the Cat_Human_OS.Interface - come to me.

Before I set off programming armed with fish. I thought about the environment I was going to be programming in. Cat brains aren't wired like human brains. I know it sounds obvious. But thats the first thing you need to start questioning. In the developer world, it's usually the obvious stuff that keeps you awake for days.

> I've spent more time than I'd ever like to admit, looking for a lost semi-colon in some arcane piece of software. The most obvious places are where they always end up.

Questioning what you know, what you think you know, and what you think you don't know. These are the daily realities of developers. We're in a constant state of learning. In our profession, we become obsolete as quickly as mobile devices. If we don't sharpen our skills relentlessly, we simply can't keep up. Every 6 months there is a new tool that redefines how we work. 

> And it's almost always adapt or perish

Back to cat brains. Betwixt the ears of Telo, resides an audio processing system unlike any other. She can hear things I simply can't, and I've got ears that can hear capacitor squeals and coil whines. So when I say "come", she hears it in colors and textures I can't quite comprehend. So each "come" being the same to me, is a different input message for her. It's no wonder she isn't responding with 200 OK. 

I'm not using the right interface.

Digital thinking forces you to think about how things connect and inter-relate. In modern development, we talk about "the stack". We actually mean a real stack. A stack of magical components built one on top of the other, like one giant onion that makes the tech world go round.

In the early days, you could directly speak to your raw metal. 0xFEED 0xBEEF 0x0020 0x7E10. And the machine would feed beef to Telo. But nowadays, there is so much separation between what we do and what the metal does it's mind boggling.

> We have client side asynchronous applications hosted by microwebservers decorating interpreted scripts which run on imaginary virtual machines running on actual virtual machines running on actual metal and spinning disks which actually look like over-sized mandolin slicers somewhere across the world

And then in all those layers it gets further abstracted. People forget how much actually is going on when you type

> console.log("we cant stop here, this is bat country")

So we as developers are always thinking about what layer of the matrix we're looking at, what strange an arcane thing could be going right or wrong thats making our thought stuff do this or that.

I was thinking in the same way with Telo. Voice commands are ok, but they're too broad. I needed a repeatable and consistent signal i could use. A message signature. That when coupled with the lossy human voice would unpack into one recognizable action.

So I used my hands. Developing a sign language interface with my cat. Point to the ground where you want her to come. Say the word "come". With the added bingo treat of mackerel on successful execution. The loop was closed.

I had an interface.

The next steps are going beyond where you planned. In the coming days my wife and I would expand the interface by generalizing it for any human who used those commands. It would require an initialization function, whereby the human provides the Telo with the mackerel. This would call the cat.bind(human) method and Telo would start recognizing the requests.

Once we had the CatOS running for multiple users, we started to flesh out the minimum viable product a bit further, and in upcoming releases launched the "Sit", "Stay", "Up", "High Five", "Shake a Paw", and "Attack"

All but "Attack" can be executed with just voice and hand signals alone. "Attack" requires the plastic bottle cap from a wide mouth plastic bottle. You have to click it to the ground and shake it along the surface. Telo will immediate assume a crouched attack position from a nearby launch site. It's pretty awesome to watch. Just hard to video.

The process was the same though, we experimented, we made mistakes, Telo made mistakes, but with consistent training data we were able to get her up and running with the new requests in less than a week. The keys.

> Whats the thing. Whats the interface. What works. What doesn't. Do what works. Document what doesn't

Here's where it gets interesting. Emergent behaviour.

So far lots of you aren't impressed. Great you trained a harder to train dog. And I wouldn't begrudge you if you thought that Telo was just a Cat_Hardware_1.0 running the most recent build of Dog_Software_3.7. But I was impressed on evening when I came home from work.

I plunked down on the couch with my laptop, like I tend to do. The clicking sounds of my 5to7-fingered monstrosity of ergonomics typing clacking away (honestly I have failed to learn to properly home row type. I touch type, but I pinky, index, thumb, thumb, index, middle, pinky - don't ask. I type for a living too.)

Telo emerged from her cat tree and sauntered over to me. Hopped up on the table in front of me, looked me square in the eyes. And then raised one paw, and open/closed it a few times. 

Observation is another key digital skill. One I'll get into in much more detail in coming stories. Observing Telo, I knew this was new behavior. And you have to remember, when you're teaching something, that something is learning, and will try to teach you something back.

> She was sending a Cat_Human_OS request back to me. She couldn't speak human, her meows all sounds the same to humans she figures. But she knows hand signals work for mackerel. Maybe the inverse works too.

I'm an intuition person. Most of the things I've done successfully in life, I've done through intuitive processes. The gut feeling I think of as a massively parallel processing of a broad range of input signals both conscious and unconscious which can only return basic replys "run", "fight", "code", "omg existential dread" - the basics

My gut was telling me, her open and closed paw was similar to the open and closed hand I make when I scratch her favorite spot on the top of her head and behind her ears. 

> I observed her signal and I intuited a response

I reached out and scratched her head. 

And cats smile. Telo got her dosage of cuddles and skritches and then sauntered off when she heard the mailbox outside rustle.

But she had successfully implemented her command, and she got the desired output.

The human, was a little in awe. I never programmed her to use sign language with me. But through my cat using the same digital skills I was, we we're onto something new. We adapted to the new paradigm pretty fast. When something shows you how much better it can be, it's hard to go back. 

> That's how we're going to win together with digital. When we start fixing those problems that give us our daily pain. A thousands upon thousands of paper cuts will deplete your Health Points pretty fast.

Communication, listening and being understood. These are among the best things in life. And they apply across the board.

In the following days, Telo too added more methods to our interface. She quickly added the "I'm hungry" sign, which she found much more responsive than the previous implementation of meow.until(forever). She now would hop up on a surface to match my eye level and extend her paw to touch my cheek once or twice. Her nails stayed sheathed.

I intuited this meant "human put fish in mouth nao"

As a result, she doesn't howl when daylight savings time ruins dinner time predictability. And we've been able to much more readily understand each others needs. 

At the end of the day that's the core of what these "new" digital skills are. They're just fancy names on things we all have been doing forever.

Figure out how to relate to each other, and whats the best way for everyone to get what they need, and get along.

The only difference now is we're adding a bunch more machines into the mix. 

> And you must learn 10 speak digital

Just don't forget how to speak human.

And love your pets. Code or otherwise.
