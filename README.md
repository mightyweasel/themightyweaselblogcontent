## The Mighty Weasel blog pre-post content

This is the staging area for my blog content. You can get the raw deets here before they go live.

And follow my updates if you really want to. It's going to be a lot of minor spelling, grammar,
and content modifications ;)

In the public service we are inspired by what we can do for the canadian public, in so many other places the answer is "maybe, let's see what happens". Forget maybe, just do. But always be ready to park the plane in the hangar waiting for the right skies to fly.

## Bloggers Should Know

The card methods are sticky. Make sure you measure twice and cut once... Use this: [Twitter Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

Also authoring direct in medium is a little less than ideal if you're coding at the sametime. I like this: https://markdowntomedium.com/

## Planned Articles

My contract ends in May, not because I want it to. Until then, welcome to the Weasel War Dance.

I aim to make people ask "why cant we" and then when they hear no ask "why not" and if the answer is because thats how we've always done I want people to ask "why". Nothing changes unless we're willing to look carefully at something and exert our collective force of will to make change possible. 

Nothing is accomplished alone.

My 30 year goal: To realize or have laid a stable foundation for a fully digital Canadian government serving the Canadian public anywhere anytime in the palm of their hand. From birth to death one consistent reliable open and effective platform for civic engagement and the future of democracy.

My 30 day goal: Dream. Build. Learn. Share. Disrupt. Repeat.

Here are the upcoming planned articles.
